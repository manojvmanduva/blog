I can’t bend my right knee beyond a point, after I met with an accident in 2002 I had PTS (Post Traumatic Stress) where my cartillege hardened while healing a fracture.

The accident happened when I was riding a motorbike with my friend Srikanth on a particular road from our college to house. It was not the regular route we take everyday.

<b>The road is less travelled, literally.</b>

Hardly people use it to get to the city from this far off place where our college is located. It had a character of its own.

Have you ever had some association with any routes like this? Maybe your route to school which you took as a child or the route you used to take to work everyday. It is interesting how these routes evoke few strange memories when you take them again later.

It happened with me after 2 years.

I had a dream of going on that road like that, again on a bike. This time Srikanth was driving and I was on backseat. After going some distance on this lonely road, we had to stop.

There was a huge fort wall like structure exactly across the road. Strange! I thought. I went close, looked up and touched the stone wall. There was no one near by. We were worried and took a U turn.

<b>I heard a big thunder. I was shaken a bit and I woke up.</b>

After few weeks, comes one of the interesting days of my life. The day that has answered many questions of my life which I had at that time like confidence, creativity, friendship, pride, trust and also started a chapter of strange events.

All of us were exhausted on the long day of 1st campus placements. We had tests, group discussions, interviews till evening for the 2 companies that visited us. There was some time before we gathered to hear out the results. Srikanth and myself thought of catching some fresh air.

<b>You guessed it. We started the bike to go on that lonely road.</b>

It didn’t take me long to realise the exact scenes repeating from my dream. Same weather, same time. I was almost waiting to see what happens next.

I was expecting to see the wall.

I heard the thunder.

It started raining heavily.

We didn’t want to stop anywhere but took a U turn , so that we don’t miss the anouncement. I didn’t find the wall, but just an old house near by.

I got selected and so is Srikanth and other friends.

Since then this phenomenon of dreams extending into reality repeated for couple of more times and then stopped.

But I always leave my door open, to <b>Stranger Things</b> in life.
