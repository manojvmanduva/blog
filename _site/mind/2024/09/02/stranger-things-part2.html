I can’t bend my right knee beyond a point, after I met with an accident in 2002 I had PTS (Post Traumatic Stress) where my cartillege hardened while healing a fracture.</p>

<p>The accident happened when I was riding a motorbike with my friend Srikanth on a particular road from our college to house. It was not the regular route we take everyday.</p>

<p><b>The road is less travelled, literally.</b></p>

<p>Hardly people use it to get to the city from this far off place where our college is located. It had a character of its own.</p>

<p>Have you ever had some association with any routes like this? Maybe your route to school which you took as a child or the route you used to take to work everyday. It is interesting how these routes evoke few strange memories when you take them again later.</p>

<p>It happened with me after 2 years.</p>

<p>I had a dream of going on that road like that, again on a bike. This time Srikanth was driving and I was on backseat. After going some distance on this lonely road, we had to stop.</p>

<p>There was a huge fort wall like structure exactly across the road. Strange! I thought. I went close, looked up and touched the stone wall. There was no one near by. We were worried and took a U turn.</p>

<p><b>I heard a big thunder. I was shaken a bit and I woke up.</b></p>

<p>After few weeks, comes one of the interesting days of my life. The day that has answered many questions of my life which I had at that time like confidence, creativity, friendship, pride, trust and also started a chapter of strange events.</p>

<p>All of us were exhausted on the long day of 1st campus placements. We had tests, group discussions, interviews till evening for the 2 companies that visited us. There was some time before we gathered to hear out the results. Srikanth and myself thought of catching some fresh air.</p>

<p><b>You guessed it. We started the bike to go on that lonely road.</b></p>

<p>It didn’t take me long to realise the exact scenes repeating from my dream. Same weather, same time. I was almost waiting to see what happens next.</p>

<p>I was expecting to see the wall.</p>

<p>I heard the thunder.</p>

<p>It started raining heavily.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to stop anywhere but took a U turn , so that we don’t miss the anouncement. I didn’t find the wall, but just an old house near by.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I got selected and so is Srikanth and other friends.</p>

<p>Since then this phenomenon of dreams extending into reality repeated for couple of more times and then stopped.</p>

<p>But I always leave my door open, to <b>Stranger Things</b> in life.</p>
